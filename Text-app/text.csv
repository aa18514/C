In particular I have always been interested with how new techniques are being explored to improve performance of procdessors while drastically reducing their power consumption. The advent of multiple cores not only allow users to run multi-threaded software applications but have the potential to run programs more efficiently than single core processors at relatively low power.What really makes ARM unique is the emphasis that it places on designing low power processors which makes it suitable for a variety of daily applications. As a result, the number of chips that contain ARM cores ",C:\Users\Asad Ahmad\Desktop\assignment3(revised).docx
